Where the [[Decoded frame format]] is suitable to feed into a program for parsing of the frames as they come in, the Hex frame format is meant to be easy to edit in a text editor, to use only a short period of the capture for further processing. It could be used to automate analysis of the period before an error occured.

After you have saved communications with the command-line option "<tt>-s comm.save</tt>", you could convert the saved file to hex format by:
<pre>
dccmon -S comm.hex -f comm.save
</pre>
Open <tt>comm.hex</tt> in a text editor, and trim it to the period you need.

Obviously, you could also have the <tt>dccmon</tt> program just output in the hex format:
<pre>
dccmon -S - /dev/ttyS0
</pre>

== The format ==
For more info on the meaning of the fields, refer to [[Decoded frame format]]. Only the differences are given. Note that there is no [[Decoded frame format#Frame length | Frame length]] field in the Hex format; length is implied by every frame being on a single line of text.

Each frame is one line of output, with the following format (each ''<tt>XX</tt>'' is one byte in hexadecimal, except for the time entry):

<tt>''HH:MM:SS FF AA PP&nbsp;&nbsp;DD DD DD...''</tt>

Note there are two spaces after <tt>PP</tt> to visually separate the data from the metadata.

{| class="wikitable"
! Element !! Meaning
|-
| <tt>''HH:MM:SS''</tt> || The time the frame was received in 24-hour format
|-
| <tt>''FF''</tt> || [[#Frame status | Frame status]]
|-
| <tt>''AA''</tt> || Board address
|- 
| <tt>''PP''</tt> || Frame protocol
|-
| <tt>''DD''</tt> || Frame data
|}

=== Frame status ===
This is a byte indicating success or failure to receive the frame from the monitoring boards. It can have the following values:
{| class="wikitable"
! Value !! Meaning
|-
| 00 || Success
|-
| fc || Big frame error
|-
| fb || Null frame error
|-
| fa || Tiny frame error
|-
| f9 || Parity error
|}

In fact, this is the 8-bit representation of the negative numbers given in the [[Decoded frame format#Frame status | Frame status]] of the [[Decoded frame format]].
